There are two types of Data-Structures which are supported by multiple programming languages.

#### Physical
-------------
These are ment for holding/storing the data inside memory.

-   Array
    -   It is a static DS which creates a contigues block of memory of a similar data type.
    -   Size of array is fixed while getting created and it cannot be increased/decreased.
    -   Useful in cases where the usable size is already known.
    -   Can be created inside a Stack and Heap[with a pointer variable in stack pointing to first address in stack]

-   Linked List
    -   It is a dynamic DS which stores the location of next node in it.
    -   Size can be increased and decreased.
    -   All the nodes of LL are always created in a Heap with a pointer to Head node in stack.



#### Logical
------------
These are ment to articulate a the dicipline followed to insert/delete/search/sort data values in structures.

-   Linear DS

    -   Stack - LIFO
    -   Queues - FIFO

-   Non-Linear DS

    -   Trees - Heirarchy
    -   Graph - Collection on Nodes, links between nodes.

-   Tabular

    -   Hash Table
